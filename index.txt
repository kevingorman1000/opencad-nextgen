Within the root directory, there will only be a few things. 

It will hold a .env file that will hold sensitive data such as database login details, encrpytion keys etc. 

It will also hold the .htaccess file for pointing all the traffic to the public/index.php file. 

It will also hold things generated by GitHub and license details. There should be NO active code apart from the two listed above in this folder.

All folders are subject to change and may be different from this very basic plan.
