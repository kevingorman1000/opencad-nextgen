# Backend And Logic

OpenCAD nextgen's new backend and logic have been designed with the goal of making it easy for developers to build upon and extend the system. The codebase is well-organized and follows industry best practices, making it easier to understand and work with. The new backend includes robust API endpoints that allow for easy integration with other systems, and supports modern technologies such as WebSockets for real-time communication. The logic of the system has been designed to be highly modular, with a focus on extensibility and customization. This makes it easy for developers to add new features or modify existing ones to meet the specific needs of their community. Overall, the new backend and logic of OpenCAD nextgen provide a solid foundation for building a robust and flexible computer aided dispatch system.

# API 

OpenCAD nextgen includes a robust API that provides easy access to the system's functionality and data. The API is designed to be fast and efficient, with endpoints that are well-documented and easy to use. It supports modern technologies such as OAuth2 authentication, allowing for secure access to the API by third-party applications. With the API, developers can easily integrate OpenCAD nextgen with other systems, such as mobile apps or web dashboards. The API also enables real-time communication using WebSockets, allowing for instant updates and notifications. Overall, the API is a key component of OpenCAD nextgen, enabling developers to extend and customize the system to meet the specific needs of their community.

# Plugin Support

Plugin support is a key feature of OpenCAD nextgen, providing developers with the ability to easily extend and customize the system to meet the specific needs of their community. The system includes a range of plugin hooks that allow developers to add new functionality to the system or modify existing functionality. Plugins can be easily installed and activated through the system's web interface, and can be enabled or disabled as needed.

OpenCAD nextgen also includes a plugin manager that provides a centralized location for managing plugins, with features such as version control, dependency management, and conflict resolution. This makes it easy for developers to manage and maintain their plugins over time.

The plugin architecture in OpenCAD nextgen is highly modular and well-documented, with a focus on ease of use and flexibility. This allows developers to build plugins using a variety of languages and frameworks, making it easier to create custom functionality that integrates seamlessly with the core system. Overall, the plugin support in OpenCAD nextgen provides a powerful tool for developers to create a highly customized and extensible computer aided dispatch system.

Overall, OpenCAD nextgen represents a significant improvement over the previous version, with a new, modern front end user interface that enhances usability and accessibility, and a range of other improvements that make it the go-to computer aided dispatch system for roleplay communities.
